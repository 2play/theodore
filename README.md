Theodore - Thomson TO8D emulator
================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Zlika/theodore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Zlika/theodore)
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/7lo7cohkpmn50ogk?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Zlika/theodore)

This is a [libretro](https://github.com/libretro) core for emulation of the [Thomson TO8D computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_TO8). It is based on Daniel Coulom's [DCTO8D](http://dcto8.free.fr/) emulator.

### How to compile

On Linux (and most other platforms):
```
make
```
You can then run the core with a libretro frontend like RetroArch:
```
retroarch -L theodore_libretro.so
```

To compile the Android version, you need the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/):
```
cd jni
ndk-build
```

### :video_game: Gamepad: mapping of the buttons

A => "Fire" button

B => Simulates a keystroke on the 'B' key of the keyboard (allows to start most games without the need of a keyboard)

### Keyboard: mapping of special keys

| Thomson keyboard | PC keyboard |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| STOP  | TAB  |
| CNT  | CTRL  |
| CAPSLOCK  | CAPSLOCK  |
| ACC  | ALT  |
| HOME  | HOME  |
| Arrows  | Arrows  |
| INS  | INSERT  |
| EFF  | DEL  |
| F1-F5  | F1-F5  |
| F6-F10  | SHIFT+F1-F5  |

### Compatibility

The source code is portable and should compile and run on most platforms.
The Travis job checks that the code builds on Linux and MacOS, and the AppVeyor job checks that the code builds on Windows.

| Platform | Compiles | Runs |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Linux / amd64 | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Raspbian / Raspberry Pi | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Android | :heavy_check_mark: | :question: |
| MacOS | :heavy_check_mark: | :question: |
| Windows | :heavy_check_mark: | :question: |
| Others | :question: | :question: |

Pull requests are welcomed to fix compilation and execution problems on other platforms.
